## Hi there 👋, I am Tom!

- **🏛️ Education:** Finished bachelor in physics early 2024 at [CAU Kiel](https://www.uni-kiel.de/de/). Now studying data science at the [FH Kiel](https://www.fh-kiel.de/startseite/). 

- **🔭 Work:** Im currently working in the [IKMB Kiel](https://www.ikmb.uni-kiel.de/) and implementing classifiers in order to predict disease development in inflamatory diseases like crohn's disease. 

- **🤔 Who am I?** I'm trying to be ambitious in work and live. Other than that I like to play guitar in a band, like to do sports to keep my back healthy and just chill with friends and do nothing.
